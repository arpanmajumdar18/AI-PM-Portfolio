# Arpan Majumdar — AI Product Manager Portfolio

This repository is my AI Product Management portfolio. It showcases my product strategy work, AI-focused case studies, roadmaps, specs, experiment results, and prototypes.

## About

I am building a portfolio that highlights experience and thinking in AI product management: defining problems, designing solutions, measuring impact, and collaborating with engineering and research teams to ship AI features responsibly.

## Projects (examples)

- Project A — Product case study: problem, approach, metrics, outcomes
- Project B — Prototype & experiment results
- Project C — Roadmap & prioritization exercises

## Skills & Focus

- Product strategy for AI-driven products
- Metrics, experimentation, and A/B testing
- Responsible AI considerations and evaluation
- Cross-functional leadership with design, ML, and engineering
